# WARNING!
This is still in development and does not fully work as a calculator. Please see version 1+ for the full calculator.

Currently, this calculator will only evaluate expressions that start and end with an integer; use only the addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division operators; and do not have subsequent operators/symbols. Parantheses/grouping to be added soon.

## Summary
Just a basic calculator.

## Instructions
When prompted, type in the mathematical expression to be evaluated.
